# ReinforcedChess
ReinforcedChess is a research-oriented chess AI project demonstrating a two-stage learning pipeline: supervised learning from human games followed by reinforcement learning via self-play. The repository includes a web interface for playing against the models, dataset processing tools, and training scripts for both SL and RL agents.
